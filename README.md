It is time to put what you have been learning to the test here is your first project brief!
Your challenge is to put everything you’ve learned in Module 2 to the test by designing, prototyping and building your own portfolio website. This website will form the foundation of your final portfolio at the end of the course, allowing you to showcase yourself and your work to its best potential. You are obviously free to iterate on the design of it as you progress through the course, but the aim for now is a high quality first draft that we can connect all your future projects to.

This task should take at least 10 hours to complete, but really we’d like you to spend as much time as possible perfecting this!

Part 1: Portfolio Wireframe

We want you to create a wireframe for your own personal portfolio using Figma. This will be the overall plan for what your portfolio will eventually look like.
Your design should contain at least three sections, defined by yourself, and a neat and simple way of navigating between the sections. It can be over multiple pages if you wish, but trends in modern design tend towards one long page to allow for a more interactive, scrollable experience.
The design should be fully responsive, looking good across mobile, tablet and desktop page sizes. We strongly recommend you wireframe all three sizes, starting with the mobile view for a mobile first approach.

Research

Below are some questions we want you to ask yourself before starting to design.
• What is a portfolio?
• What is the point of it?
• Who is my audience?
• What is the most important part of it?
• What elements / pages might you see on a portfolio?

Below are some great links to help you do your research.
• Nology Portfolios : Previous Nology students work.
• Awwwards : Commercial portfolio’s.
• One Page Love : Resource for single page / scrolling websites.
• Land Book : Resource of landing pages.
• Media Queries : Resource for websites at different breakpoints.

Interactive Prototype

While you are free to simply wireframe and get the views sorted, we also recommend prototyping some interactivity into your design so you have this clear before you start programming. Use Figma to its potential!

Feedback

Once you have completed your prototype, submit your designs to a Coach for review. No need to wait to start programming but it's good to get some feedback!

Part 2: Let’s build!

We’re aiming for the following goals for this project:
1. A working Portfolio: The main task is to create a portfolio to showcase what you will be learning on the course and to give the visitors an insight to who you are.
2. Practice using Git and GitHub flow: We want you to get as much practice as possible using git, GitHub and the command line.
3. Apply what you are learning: This is a great place to apply what you have been learning on the course. Push on, use SCSS, BEM, a framework like Bootstrap, anything else you find on the web....really go mad!
        
Requirements

• You need to have it as a public repository on GitHub
• In the repo you will also need a README.md with a short intro to the project and a link to your Figma wireframe.
• You are to use SCSS for styling.
• You are to use B.E.M as a naming convention.
• We would like you to take a Mobile first approach to the implementation. If media
queries have been covered.
• Responsiveness is vital – use Grid, Flex, whatever you wish but the site must look good
at all screen widths.

Submission

Once you have completed your prototype, book in a review session and send your portfolio code in GitHub, as well as the code from module 2 to the coaches.
